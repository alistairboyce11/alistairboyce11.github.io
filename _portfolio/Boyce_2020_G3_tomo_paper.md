New paper out in Gcubed - Feb 2021. In this paper we develop the AFRP20 tomographic model by incorporating >87,000 absolute arrival time picks from African temporary seismograph deployments into a continental scale P-wave tomographic model. We specifically investigate multiple whole-mantle upwellings below East Africa and evidence for modification of the Tanzanian craton associated with the Pan-African orogeny.
