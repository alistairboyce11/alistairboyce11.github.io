Paper submitted to Gcubed - July 2020. In this paper I develop the AFRP20 tomographic model by incorporating >87,000 absolute arrival time picks from African temporary seismograph deployments into a continental scale P-wave tomographic model. I specifically investigate evidence for multiple whole-mantle upwellings below East Africa and evidence for modification of the Tanzanian craton associated with the Pan-African orogeny.

More news to follow!
