New paper out in EPSL - August 2019! In this paper I use a new database of absolute arrival times derived from temporary seismograph networks in Canada to supplement dense station network coverage in the US to image along-strike variation in P-wave mantle structure in the Proterozoic Grenville Orogen. This wavespeed variation is likely due to varying metasomatic modification during protracted Grenvillian subduction. We show that P-wave images are valuable to understand fully craton margin evolution!
