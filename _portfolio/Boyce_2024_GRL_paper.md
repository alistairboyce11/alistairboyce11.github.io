New paper out in JGR - Feb 2024. In this paper we show that:

* Bayesian surface wave inversion reconciles existing differences between seismic images of craton structure from long and short period data
* Cratons possess a shallow low velocity zone (LVZ) within a layer of positive radial anisotropy and a high velocity isotropic layer beneath
* Cratons are formed in two stages shown by anisotropic structure and are later modified producing a LVZ and mid lithosphere discontinuities
