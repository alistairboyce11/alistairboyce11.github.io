New paper out in Gcubed - Feb 2021. In this paper we use the [AFRP20 tomographic model](https://doi.org/10.17611/dp/emc.2021.afrp20bea.1) to depth convert receiver functions to investigate the impact of multiple upwellings below the African continent on mantle transition zone discontinuities.
We find a thin transition zone underlies East African Cenozoic magmatism implying influence of processes at mantle transition zone depths or below.
We suggest that a thermochemically distinct upwelling underlies Kenya while a purely thermal upwelling underlies Ethiopia.
