The Deep Earth Explorers Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences exhibit opened in Cambridge on 6th March 2020. Our group has been working on this project for over a year! I led the "Explaining waves" component which demonstrates the different types of waves we use to image the Earth. The user can interact with a Rasberry Pi RF-ID reader to choose the part of the Earth they would like to investigate!

The python codes used to operate the Rasberry Pi and generate the 6 Explaining waves videos can be found [here](https://github.com/alistairboyce11/explaining_waves).
